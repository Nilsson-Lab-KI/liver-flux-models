# Liver metabolic flux models

This repository contains the current metabolic network model used for analyses described in the manuscript _Global 13C tracing and metabolic flux analysis of intact human liver tissue ex vivo_ by Grankvist, JÃ¶nsson et al. The model development history is documented in the git logs. For the associated metabolic flux analysis code, please see the [liver-flux-analysis](https://github.com/Nilsson-Lab-KI/liver-flux-analysis) repo.
